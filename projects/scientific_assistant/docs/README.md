# Scientific Assistant Documentation

This directory centralises specifications, logs, and retrospectives for the scientific assistant project.

## Structure

- `Today's_Spec.md` – Latest working specification and experiment plan
- `postmortems/` – Incident and run post-mortems for previous experiments

Additional documents specific to the project should be placed here to keep the root `docs/` directory project-agnostic.
