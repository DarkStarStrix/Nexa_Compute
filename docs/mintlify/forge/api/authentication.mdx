# Authentication

All API requests require an API key. Generate a key in the Dashboard → Settings page.

## Using the API Key
Add the header `X-Nexa-Api-Key: YOUR_KEY` to every request.

```bash
curl -H "X-Nexa-Api-Key: abcdef123456" https://api.nexa.ai/api/jobs
```

## Security Recommendations
- Keep keys secret; never commit them to source control.
- Rotate keys regularly via the dashboard.
- Use HTTPS for all requests.
