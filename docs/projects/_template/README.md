# Project Template

This directory defines the scaffold copied when a new NexaCompute project is created.

Placeholders follow Jinja-style markers (e.g., `{{project_slug}}`, `{{project_name}}`) and are replaced by the scaffold CLI.

## Contents

- `configs/` – Example training/evaluation configurations
- `pipelines/` – Sample pipeline manifest
- `docs/` – Documentation skeleton
- `manifests/` – Project manifest template

The scaffold command copies this directory, substitutes placeholders, and creates project-specific data/artifact directories.
